            Here's a step-by-step guide to making Idli, Sambhar, and Coconut Chutney:

            Idli
            Ingredients:
            
            2 cups idli rice
            1 cup urad dal (split black gram)
            1 tsp fenugreek seeds
            Salt to taste
            Water as needed
            Instructions:
            
            Soaking: Wash the idli rice and urad dal separately. Soak the rice and fenugreek seeds together in water for about 6 hours. Soak the urad dal separately for the same amount of time.
            Grinding: Drain the water from the rice and grind it into a fine batter. Drain the urad dal and grind it separately into a smooth and fluffy batter. Mix both batters together in a large bowl.
            Fermentation: Add salt and mix well. Cover the bowl and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight.
            Steaming: Once the batter is fermented, pour it into greased idli molds. Steam in an idli steamer or pressure cooker without the whistle for about 10-12 minutes. Check if done by inserting a toothpick; it should come out clean.
            Serving: Remove the idlis from the molds and serve hot.
            Sambhar
            Ingredients:
            
            1 cup toor dal (split pigeon peas)
            1/2 tsp turmeric powder
            1 tbsp tamarind paste
            1 cup mixed vegetables (carrot, potato, drumstick, etc.)
            2 tbsp sambhar powder
            Salt to taste
            2 tbsp oil
            1 tsp mustard seeds
            1/2 tsp fenugreek seeds
            A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
            10-12 curry leaves
            2 dried red chilies
            1 onion, chopped
            1 tomato, chopped
            Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
            Instructions:
            
            Cooking Dal: Wash and cook the toor dal with turmeric powder in a pressure cooker until soft. Mash the cooked dal and set aside.
            Cooking Vegetables: In a pot, cook the mixed vegetables with enough water until tender. Add tamarind paste and let it simmer.
            Making Sambhar: Add the cooked and mashed dal to the vegetables. Stir in the sambhar powder and salt. Let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.
            Tempering: Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and let them crackle. Add fenugreek seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves, dried red chilies, chopped onion, and tomato. Sauté until onions turn golden brown.
            Final Touch: Add the tempering to the sambhar and mix well. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
            Coconut Chutney
            Ingredients:
            
            1 cup grated fresh coconut
            2 tbsp roasted chana dal (Bengal gram)
            1-2 green chilies
            1/2 inch ginger piece
            Salt to taste
            Water as needed
            1 tsp oil
            1/2 tsp mustard seeds
            1 dried red chili
            8-10 curry leaves
            A pinch of asafoetida (hing)
            Instructions:
            
            Grinding: In a blender, grind the grated coconut, roasted chana dal, green chilies, ginger, and salt with enough water to make a smooth paste. Transfer to a bowl.
            Tempering: Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and let them crackle. Add dried red chili, curry leaves, and asafoetida. Sauté for a few seconds.
            Final Touch: Pour the tempering over the ground coconut mixture and mix well.
