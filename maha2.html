Making the Misal
Temper Spices: Heat oil in a pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add cumin seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves.
Saute Vegetables: Add finely chopped onions and green chili. Saute until onions turn golden brown. Add ginger-garlic paste and saute until the raw smell disappears.
Cook Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and oil starts to separate.
Add Spices: Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, goda masala, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.
Add Sprouts: Add the cooked sprouts along with their water. Add tamarind pulp and salt. Mix well and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes until the flavors meld together.
Making the Kat (Spicy Gravy)
Roast Coconut: In a separate pan, dry roast the grated coconut until it turns golden brown. Set aside.
Saute Onions: In the same pan, heat oil and add chopped onions. Saute until they turn golden brown.
Cook Tomatoes: Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft.
Add Spices: Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, goda masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.
Grind Mixture: Let the mixture cool and then grind it into a fine paste using a little water.
