            Puran Poli is a popular sweet flatbread from the Indian states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, made with a sweet filling of chana dal (split Bengal gram) and jaggery. Here's a step-by-step recipe:
<p>
Ingredients
For the Dough

2 cups whole wheat flour
2 tablespoons oil or ghee
A pinch of salt
Water, as needed

For the Filling (Puran)

1 cup chana dal
1 cup jaggery, grated
1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
A pinch of nutmeg powder (optional)
2 tablespoons ghee

*Instructions

*Preparing the Dough

1.Mix Dough Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, oil or ghee, and a pinch of salt.
2.Knead Dough: Gradually add water and knead into a soft, pliable dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.

*Preparing the Filling

1.Cook Chana Dal: Wash the chana dal thoroughly and pressure cook it with enough water until soft but not mushy (about 4-5 whistles).
Drain and Mash: Drain any excess water from the cooked dal and mash it well.

2.Cook with Jaggery: In a pan, add the mashed dal and grated jaggery. Cook on medium heat, stirring continuously until the mixture thickens and starts leaving the sides of the pan.

3.Add Spices: Add the cardamom powder and nutmeg powder, mix well, and remove from heat. Let the mixture cool.

*Assembling Puran Poli

1.Divide Dough and Filling: Divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls and the filling into equal portions.

2.Roll Out Dough: Take a dough ball, flatten it slightly, and roll it into a small disc.

3.Stuff with Filling: Place a portion of the filling in the center of the dough disc. Gather the edges of the dough and seal them over the filling, ensuring there are no gaps.

4.Roll Out Filled Dough: Gently roll out the stuffed dough ball into a flat disc, about 6-8 inches in diameter. Be careful not to tear the dough and expose the filling.

*Cooking Puran Poli

1.Heat Pan: Heat a tawa or griddle over medium heat.

2.Cook Puran Poli: Place the rolled-out puran poli on the hot tawa. Cook until golden brown spots appear on one side, then flip and cook the other side.

3.Add Ghee: Apply a little ghee on both sides while cooking to enhance the flavor and texture.

4.Repeat: Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.

*Serving

#Serve puran poli warm with a dollop of ghee or alongside milk or yogurt.

Enjoy your delicious homemade puran poli!</p>
