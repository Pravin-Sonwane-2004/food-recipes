            Ingredients:
            1 cup gram flour (besan)
            1 cup yogurt
            2 cups water
            1 teaspoon ginger paste
            1 teaspoon green chili paste
            1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
            Salt to taste
            For tempering:
            2 tablespoons oil
            1 teaspoon mustard seeds
            1 teaspoon sesame seeds
            1 pinch asafoetida (hing)
            Few curry leaves
            2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise
            2 tablespoons grated coconut
            2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves
            Instructions:
            Mixing the Batter:
            
            In a mixing bowl, combine gram flour, yogurt, water, ginger paste, green chili paste, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well to make a lump-free batter.
            Cooking the Batter:
            
            Transfer the batter to a non-stick pan. Cook the batter on low heat, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
            Cook until the batter thickens and becomes smooth. It should take about 8-10 minutes. The batter should be of spreading consistency.
            Spreading the Mixture:
            
            Quickly spread a thin layer of the cooked batter onto the back of a greased plate or a clean kitchen counter. Use a flat spatula to spread the batter evenly.
            Rolling the Khandvi:
            
            Allow the spread batter to cool for a few minutes. Then, make cuts with a knife to form thin strips.
            Gently roll each strip into a tight roll. Repeat the process with all the strips.
            Preparing the Tempering:
            
            Heat oil in a small pan. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter.
            Add sesame seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves, and green chilies. Saut√© for a few seconds.
            Tempering the Khandvi:
            
            Pour the tempering over the rolled khandvi rolls evenly.
            Garnishing:
            
            Garnish with grated coconut and chopped coriander leaves.
            Serving:
            
            Allow the khandvi to cool completely before serving.
            Enjoy your homemade khandvi!
