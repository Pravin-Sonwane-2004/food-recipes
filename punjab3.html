            Ingredients:

            2 cups whole wheat flour
            1 cup yogurt (dahi)
            1-2 green chilies, finely chopped
            1 medium onion, finely chopped
            1 tablespoon fresh coriander leaves, finely chopped
            1 teaspoon cumin seeds
            1 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)
            1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
            1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
            Salt to taste
            Water (as needed)
            Ghee or oil for cooking
            Instructions:
            
            Prepare the Dough:
            
            In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour, finely chopped green chilies, onion, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, ajwain, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt.
            Add the yogurt to the mixture and start mixing. The moisture in the yogurt will help in binding the flour.
            Knead the mixture into a soft dough. If needed, add a little water to achieve the desired consistency.
            Cover the dough and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
            Roll Out the Parathas:
            
            Divide the dough into equal portions and shape them into balls.
            Dust each ball with a little flour and roll them out into a circle of about 5-6 inches in diameter.
            Cook the Parathas:
            
            Heat a tawa (griddle) over medium heat.
            Place the rolled-out dough on the hot tawa. Cook for a minute until bubbles start to form.
            Flip the paratha and apply a little ghee or oil on the cooked side.
            Flip again and apply ghee or oil on the other side. Cook until both sides are golden brown and crispy.
            Press gently with a spatula to ensure even cooking.
            Serve:
            
            Serve the dahi parathas hot with yogurt, pickles, or any chutney of your choice.
            Enjoy your delicious and flavorful dahi parathas!
