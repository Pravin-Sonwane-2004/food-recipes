            <p>Kothimbir Vadi is a popular Maharashtrian snack made from fresh coriander leaves and chickpea flour. It is flavorful and can be enjoyed as a tea-time snack or appetizer. Here is a traditional recipe for Kothimbir Vadi:

Ingredients:
1 cup fresh coriander leaves (kothimbir), finely chopped
1 cup besan (chickpea flour)
2 tablespoons rice flour
1 teaspoon sesame seeds
1 teaspoon turmeric powder
1 teaspoon red chili powder
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
1 teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain)
1/2 teaspoon baking soda (optional)
1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste
2 green chilies, finely chopped
1/2 teaspoon sugar
Salt to taste
Water as needed
Oil for greasing and frying
Instructions:
Step 1: Preparing the Batter
Mixing Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, add the besan, rice flour, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin seeds, carom seeds, sesame seeds, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, sugar, and salt. Mix well.
Adding Coriander: Add the finely chopped coriander leaves to the dry mixture and combine well.
Making the Batter: Gradually add water to the mixture and mix to form a thick, smooth batter. Ensure there are no lumps. The batter should be thick enough to hold its shape but not too dry.
Step 2: Steaming the Batter
Preparing for Steaming: Grease a steaming tray or a flat plate with oil. Pour the batter into the tray and spread it evenly to about 1/2 inch thickness.
Steaming: Steam the batter in a steamer or pressure cooker (without the whistle) for about 15-20 minutes on medium heat, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Cooling: Allow the steamed batter to cool completely before cutting it into square or diamond-shaped pieces.
Step 3: Frying the Vadis
Heating Oil: Heat oil in a pan or kadai for shallow frying or deep frying the vadis.
Frying: Once the oil is hot, gently slide in the cut vadis and fry them until they turn golden brown and crisp on both sides. Remove and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
Step 4: Serving
Serving: Serve the kothimbir vadi hot with green chutney or tamarind chutney.
Enjoy your delicious and crispy Kothimbir Vadi!</p>
