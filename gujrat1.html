            Fafda Recipe
            Ingredients:
            
            1 cup chickpea flour (besan)
            1/4 teaspoon baking soda
            1/4 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds)
            1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
            Salt to taste
            2 tablespoons oil (for dough)
            Oil for frying
            Water as needed
            Instructions:
            
            Prepare the Dough:
            
            In a bowl, mix chickpea flour, baking soda, ajwain, turmeric powder, and salt.
            Add 2 tablespoons of oil and mix well.
            Gradually add water to the mixture and knead it into a soft dough. The dough should be smooth and pliable.
            Shaping the Fafdas:
            
            Divide the dough into small portions.
            Take a portion and roll it into a log shape.
            Flatten it slightly with your fingers and place it on a flat surface.
            Using the heel of your palm, press and stretch the dough into a long, thin strip.
            Frying:
            
            Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat.
            Once the oil is hot, fry the fafdas until they turn golden and crispy.
            Remove and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
            Jalebi Recipe
            Ingredients:
            
            1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
            2 tablespoons cornstarch
            1/2 teaspoon baking powder
            1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
            1 cup yogurt (curd)
            1 cup sugar
            1/2 cup water
            Saffron strands (optional)
            Oil or ghee for frying
            Instructions:
            
            Prepare the Batter:
            
            In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, cornstarch, and baking powder.
            Add yogurt and mix well to form a smooth batter. The batter should be thick but flowing.
            Cover the batter and let it ferment for 6-8 hours or overnight.
            Prepare the Sugar Syrup:
            
            In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.
            Heat the mixture over medium heat until the sugar dissolves.
            Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using) and simmer until the syrup reaches a one-thread consistency.
            Keep the syrup warm.
            Frying the Jalebis:
            
            Heat oil or ghee in a wide, flat pan over medium heat.
            Pour the batter into a squeeze bottle or piping bag with a small nozzle.
            Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in circular motions to form spirals.
            Fry until golden and crispy.
            Remove and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup for a few seconds.
            Take out and place on a plate to let the excess syrup drain.
            Serving:
            Serve the hot, crispy fafdas with spicy green chutney and papaya chutney.
            Enjoy the jalebis warm or at room temperature.
            This combination is a delightful mix of savory and sweet, making it a perfect treat for any occasion.
